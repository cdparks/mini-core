# Mini-Core
## Overview
Mini-Core is an implementation of the Core language described in [Implementing Functional Languages: A Tutorial](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/pj-lester-book/) by Simon Peyton Jones & David Lester. I'm following the book fairly closely, but I'm using Haskell instead of Miranda.
